# Algorithm-and-DataStructure
This is a foundational course in computer science that covers both theoretical concepts and practical software design.
It provides the necessary prerequisites for more advanced courses in computer science. 
The course includes topics such as algorithm analysis, fundamental algorithms, fundamental data structures, and program design.
From this course the students will learn about simpler analysis methods for algorithm resource needs such as time and memory, as well as specific algorithms such as numerical, search, and sorting algorithms.
Labs are also included to provide hands-on experience with the concepts learned, covering topics such as sorting, searching, and graphs.


The course covers the topics that are:
1. Singly linked list
2. Doubly linked list
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Hash table
6. Trees
7. Binary search tree
8. Heap
